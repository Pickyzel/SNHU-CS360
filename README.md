# SNHU-CS360

The requirments that is project needed was to have functionality to add/delete items as well as update the counts on the items. The project also need to utilize a local database to hold the users inventory
data and hold login information. If a user doesn't have an account the program will need to allow to create a new account. For the needed functionality the there needed to be four UI pages. The first 
would be the login screen. The secound would be the account creation page. The last two pages would be the SMS notifations permissions page and the main inventory page. The process I followed was first considering what requirments and user needs would be needed for the project. After that a sat down and figured out what UI pages would be needed and designed what they would look for. Started to create the database and then coded all the functionality. This method would work for a series of different projects in the future. To test I followed what requirments were needed and validated that all functionality worked as intended.
The biggest challenge I faced was the functionality. Multiple times I had to felt like I broke something with the software I was using and restarted the project. I started to find the design option of the software to become easier for me. I was easily able to understand how it worked and started to research more components that I could use if I so chose to do so.
